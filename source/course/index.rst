Pedagogy
======================================

The pedagogy used is that of `Flipped classroom <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom>`_. 

Therefore, it is imperative that students work from home:

* read the mentioned chapters of the reference book,
* program regularly by doing the exercises offered on INGInious_
* prepare theoretical questions.

It is important that you **get the reference book as soon as possible**.
There are about twenty for rent in BST.
