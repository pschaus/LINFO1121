Try to complete these exercises within three hours to assess if you are ready for the exam.

It is recommended to:
*Read through all the exercises first.
* Start with the one you find the easiest.
* Avoid spending all your time on a single exercise. The exam grading is not binary; you can still earn points for correct results even if the time complexity isnâ€™t optimal.
* Review the unit test source code. This is crucial for debugging your code. Additionally, make use of the debugger.
