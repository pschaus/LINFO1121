At the end of this part each student will be able to:

* make the distinction between the notations :math:`\mathcal{\sim}`, :math:`\mathcal{O}`,
   :math:`\mathcal{\Theta}`, and :math:`\mathcal{\Omega}`, know their properties and definitions;
* describe precisely the properties of the abstract types *stack* and *queue*;
   as well as the various types of chained lists;
* distinguish between an *abstract data type* and its implementation
* implement and evaluate an implementation of a stack by a *simply or doubly chained list*;
* use *unit tests* (with JUnit) to test and prove the correct operation of a program
* use the various collections present in the Java language, with the help of the documentation.
