Organization (read this first)
************************************

The reference book used for this course is
`Algorithms <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/>`_ (4th Edition)
by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

It is important that you **get this book as soon as possible**.
There are about twenty for rent in BST.


Pedagogy
======================================

The pedagogy used is that of `Flipped classroom <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom>`_. 

Therefore, it is imperative that students work from home:

* read the mentioned chapters of the reference book,
* program regularly by doing the exercises offered on INGInious_
* prepare theoretical questions.

The course uses the *Java* language and more specifically the Java8_ version.
The recommended IDE for this course and available for the exam is IntelliJ_.
We will also use the Junit5_ tool to perform unit tests.
It is strongly recommended that you familiarize yourself with these tools in preparation for the exam.



.. _Java8: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api
.. _IntelliJ: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
.. _INGInious: https://inginious.info.ucl.ac.be
.. _JUnit5: https://junit.org/junit5/



Cours Open-Source
=======================================



The source code of all programming exercises are available on Github

* `Github Repository <https://github.com/pschaus/algorithms_exercises_students>`_ without the solutions
* `Github Repository <https://github.com/pschaus/algorithms_exercises>`_ with the solutions (it is not recommended to read the solution to an exercise before having tried really hard to solve it). The best way to use the solution is to compare it with your own solution. 


Motivated students can also propose new exercises as pull requests.
