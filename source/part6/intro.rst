Objectives
===========


Upon completion of this section, each student will be able to:

*describe* with accuracy and precision the concepts present in the reference book chapter that deals with *graphs*,
*evaluate* and *implement* classical representations of graphs,
*choose* an appropriate representation of a graph based on the operations to be performed on that graph,
*implement* graph traversal and manipulation algorithms, in particular
    * depth and breadth first search:
        * computation of connected components (computation of strongly connected components is not covered in this course)
        * cycle detection
        * topological sorting
    * computation of minimum weight spanning trees (Kruskal and Prim)
    * computation of shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
